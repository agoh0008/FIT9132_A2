# FIT9132: Assignment 2 - Tourism Management System (Creating, Populating and Manipulating Databases)

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 2 of the FIT9132 unit (Introduction to Databases).

This involves implementing, via SQL, a small database in the Oracle RDBMS from a provided logical model case study, followed by the insert of appropriate data to the created tables. Once populated the database will be used to carry out specified DML commands and make specified changes to the database structure via SQL. SQL and NoSQL are then used to write queries to produce specified output.

Outcomes:
- Apply the theories of the relational database model.
- Implement a relational database based on a sound database design.
- Manage data that meets user requirements, including queries and transactions.
- Contrast the differences between non-relational database models and the relational database model.
